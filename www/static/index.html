            <p>Oak is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language
            with a focus on simplicity and asynchrony, designed for (my) hobby
            projects. Idiomatic Oak code borrows often from the functional
            programming paradigm.</p>
            <p>Oak code is easy to read and write, and Oak programs are
            practically capable — common tasks like running simple web servers,
            working with files, and rendering a web UI are straightforward. Oak
            has good support for concurrency and asynchronous programming with
            easy fall-backs to synchronous execution when it's simpler.</p>
            <p>It borrows basic syntax and semantics from Lua and JavaScript:
            Oak has lists and objects, the null value, and first-class
            functions. But unlike those languages (at least, until recently),
            Oak has distinct 64-bit integer and floating-point types, as well
            as atoms (also called keywords).</p>
            <p>The <code>oak</code> command-line tool ships an interpreter, but
            also includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a rich <a href="/lib/">standard library</a></li>
                <li>a code formatter</li>
                <li>a bundler and an Oak-to-JavaScript compiler</li>
                <li>a test runner</li>
                <li>a tool for working with documentation in source files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a result, all of Oak ships as a single executable file, and
            Oak programs can be deployed as a single source "bundle". This
            makes development and deployment easy.</p>
            <p>Since late 2021, Oak has been my main programming language for
            simple scripts, side projects, and
            <a href="https://thesephist.com/projects/">personal knowledge tools</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>How Oak came to be</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was
            <a href="https://dotink.co" target="_blank">Ink</a>.
            Ink was a toy programming language, and I used it to build
            everything from personal productivity apps to compilers to ray
            tracers. Ink was wonderful, but had a handful of shortcomings and
            misfeatures that became more and more obvious over time as I used
            it.</p>
            <p>Oak is a sequel to Ink that tries to correct many of these early
            mistakes, while being easier to read and use. Oak is intentionally
            not "Ink 2.0" — it's not a simple upgrade or bug fix, but a
            different language with many well-considered updates in the
            details.</p>
            <p>I've been building Oak since early July 2021. The core language
            and basic standard libraries are complete, but still feel too
            unstable to call it ready, and there's a lot missing that I'd like
            to add to Oak's tooling, like built-in utilities for testing,
            documentation generation, and perhaps even deployment. This is also
            why this website is very bare today — I haven't had time to
            stabilize and document much of anything yet!</p>

            <h2 id="start">Try Oak</h2>
            <p>You can download Oak from
            <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/oak/releases">the GitHub releases page</a>.
            I currently build and test release versions of Oak for Linux and
            macOS. To install, follow the instructions below for your operating
            system.</p>

            <h2>An introduction to Oak</h2>
            <p><em>What follows here is a work-in-progress — it'll probably evolve as Oak itself grows.</em></p>

            <details open>
                <summary><h3>The REPL</h3></summary>
                <p>The easiest way to run Oak code is through the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>,
                which you can start by simply running <code>oak</code> at your
                terminal. Try running the program <code>1 + 2 + 3</code>.</p>
                <pre><code>$ oak
&gt; 1 + 2 + 3
6
&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>The REPL will evaluate the expression typed in, print its
                value, and wait for your next input. At the REPL, all standard
                libraries are exposed by default through their names. For
                example, we can see the current time using the <code>datetime</code>
                library.</p>
                <pre><code>&gt; time() |&gt; datetime.format()
'2022-01-27T07:56:11.680098056793213Z'
&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>At the REPL, we can type out the classic Hello World
                program. Here, the program prints <code>Hello, World!</code>,
                and <em>returns</em> the value <code>14</code>, which is the
                number of bytes printed (which we usually ignore).</p>
                <pre><code>&gt; std.println('Hello, World!')
Hello, World!
14
&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>You can hit <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-D</kbd> to exit
                the REPL and return to your shell.</p>

                <summary><h3>Writing Oak programs</h3></summary>
                <p>Oak programs are written in files ending with
                <code>.oak</code>.  You can pass other files to the
                <code>oak</code> CLI to run them, but when
                <code>import(...)</code>-ing files, Oak will only look for
                <code>.oak</code> files.</p>
                <p>We can run Oak programs by simply passing it to
                <code>oak</code>.</p>
                <pre><code>$ cat hello.oak
std := import('std')
std.println('My first Oak program')

$ oak hello.oak
My first Oak program</code></pre>
                <p>Here's a more realistic Oak program.</p>
                <pre><code>std := import('std')

fn fizzbuzz(n) if [n % 3, n % 5] {
    [0, 0] -&gt; 'FizzBuzz'
    [0, _] -&gt; 'Fizz'
    [_, 0] -&gt; 'Buzz'
    _ -&gt; string(n)
}

std.range(1, 101) |&gt; std.each(fn(n) {
    std.println(fizzbuzz(n))
})</code></pre>

                <summary><h3>Values, types, functions, and modules</h3></summary>
                <p>Oak has 10 different types of values. Oak is strongly typed,
                so moving a value between any of these types requires explicit
                conversion via a function, like <code>int()</code>. These 10
                types are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <em>null value</em>, written <code>?</code></li>
                    <li>The <em>empty value</em>, written <code>_</code>, which is equal to all values, and useful for pattern-matching</li>
                    <li>Booleans, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code></li>
                    <li>Integers like <code>10</code>, <code>-42</code>, <code>1000000</code></li>
                    <li>Floating-point numbers like <code>0.0</code>, <code>3.141592</code>, <code>-123456.789</code></li>
                    <li>Strings, mutable sequences of bytes, always written with single quotes like <code>'Hi'</code></li>
                    <li>Atoms or "keywords", written like <code>:name</code>,which are immutable strings used like enums or tags</li>
                    <li>Lists, written like <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, which can contain any other Oak value</li>
                    <li>Objects, written like <code>{ name: 'Linus' }</code>, which are unordered dictionaries from string keys to any other Oak value</li>
                    <li>Functions, which are defined with the <code>fn</code> keyword, like <code>fn double(n) 2 * n</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most values in Oak behave the way you'd expect, so here, let
                me draw your attention to the quirks unique to Oak.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no implicit type casting between any types, except during arithmetic operations when ints may be cast up to floats.</li>
                    <li>Both ints and floats are full 64-bit precision values.</li>
                    <li>Strings are mutable byte arrays, also used for arbitrary data storage in memory, like in Lua. For immutable strings, use atoms.</li>
                    <li>For lists and objects, equality (the <code>=</code> operator) is defined as deep equality. <em>There is no identity equality in Oak.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We define a function in Oak with the <code>fn</code>
                keyword. A name is optional, and if given, will define that
                function in that scope. If there are no arguments, the
                <code>()</code> may be omitted.</p>
                <pre><code>fn double(n) 2 * n
fn speak {
    println('Hello!')
}</code></pre>
                <p>In broad strokes, Oak is a conventional imperative,
                expression-based, scripting language. Rather than re-introduce
                the whole language, here are the pieces that might set Oak
                apart from other languages you're familiar with.</p>

                <details open>
                    <summary><h4>Naming things</h4></summary>
                    <p>Oak variables and functions can begin with letters and
                    the "_", "!", "?" characters, and can also contain numbers
                    after the first character.  <code>ProductionEnv?</code>,
                    <code>invalidate!</code>, <code>num_attendees</code>, and
                    <code>___runtime_gc</code> are all valid Oak
                    identifiers.</p>
                    <p>There are two loosely enforced naming conventions in
                    Oak. First, global constants begin with uppercase letters,
                    but are not written <code>ALL_CAPS</code>. Second, names
                    starting with an underscore, like
                    <code>_bootstrapServer</code>, are considered private to
                    the file and shouldn't be imported into other modules.
                    (However, this isn't currently enforced.)</p>

                    <summary><h4>Everything is an expression</h4></summary>
                    <p>In Oak, everything is an expression. Function
                    definitions return the defined function; variable
                    declarations and assignments return the new value;
                    conditional expressions evaluate to their final value.
                    Multiple expressions may be grouped into a single "block"
                    with <code>(...)</code> or <code>{...}</code>, which are
                    themselves expressions that evaluate to the last expression
                    in the block.</p>
                </details>

                <details open>
                    <summary><h4>Recursion: it's recursion</h4></summary>
                    <p>Oak doesn't have language constructs for looping like
                    <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>, but has robust
                    support for recursion and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">optimized tail calls</a>,
                    which is the preferred way of expressing loops — after one
                    iteration, the function calls itself again to run the next
                    iteration. For example, the <code>each</code> standard
                    library function is implemented with a recursive
                    sub-function <code>fn sub</code>:</p>
                    <pre><code>fn each(xs, f) {
    fn sub(i) if i {
        len(xs) -&gt; ?
        _ -&gt; {
            f(xs.(i), i)
            sub(i + 1)
        }
    }
    sub(0)
}</code></pre>
                    <p>In practice, we rarely write tail-recursive functions by
                    hand for loops, and instead depend on standard library
                    functions like <code>range</code>, <code>map</code>,
                    <code>each</code>, <code>filter</code>, and
                    <code>reduce</code> to express iteration.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><h4><code>if</code> expressions</h4></summary>
                    <p>Oak uses one construct for control flow -- the
                    <code>if</code> expression. Unlike a traditional
                    <code>if</code> expression, which can only test for truthy
                    and falsy values, Oak's <code>if</code> acts like a
                    sophisticated switch-case, checking the target value in
                    each "branch" until one that deeply equals the original
                    value is reached.</p>
                    <pre><code>fn pluralize(word, count) if count {
    1 -&gt; word
    2 -&gt; 'a pair of ' + word + 's'
    _ -&gt; word + 's'
}</code></pre>
                    <p>The true value of Oak's <code>if</code> expressions is
                    its ability to match against complex shapes of data. For
                    example, you might find this snippet in some server
                    code:</p>
                    <pre><code>if resp {
    { status: :ok, body: _ } -&gt; handleResponse(resp)
    { status: :error, body: 'unknown' } -&gt; handleUnknownError(resp)
    { status: :error, body: _ } -&gt; handleGenericError(resp)
    _ -&gt; pass(resp)
}</code></pre>
                    <p>The <code>if</code> expression has a few different
                    shorthands. The following pairs of expressions are
                    equivalent — they're syntactic sugar for each other.</p>
                    <pre><code>if show? -&gt; showDialog()
if show? {
    true -&gt; showDialog()
}

                    <summary><h4>Lists and objects</h4></summary>
                    <p>Oak uses lists and objects to organize state and data in programs.</p>
                    <p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of
                    values. We can access and update the value of a list
                    anywhere using an integer index, and append to the end of a
                    list using the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator. However, we
                    can't remove values from the middle of a list — to do so,
                    we'll need to create a new list that doesn't contain the
                    values we don't want.</p>
                    <pre><code>fruits := [:apple, :orange]
fruits &lt;&lt; :pear
fruits.1 := :grapefruit

// fruits = [:apple, :grapefruit, :pear]</code></pre>
                    <p>An <strong>object</strong> is an unordered dictionary
                    relating string keys to arbitrary values. We can access and
                    update values, add new values, and delete values by keys,
                    but the values inserted into an object
                    <em>do not remember the order in which they were added</em>
                    — the order in which Oak loops through items in an object
                    may change randomly.</p>
                    <pre><code>profile := {
    name: 'Linus Lee'
    age: ?
    work: 'Thought &amp; Craft'
    languages: ['Oak', 'Ink', 'JavaScript', 'Go']
}

// access and update values
profile.age := 23
profile.('work') := 'Writer'

// delete values by assigning _
profile.age := _

// get all keys of the object
keys(profile) // ['name', 'work', 'languages']
</code></pre>
                    <p>Accessing an index that is out of bounds in a list, or
                    accessing an object with a key that doesn't exist on that
                    object, will evaluate to <code>?</code>, the null
                    value.</p>

                    <summary><h4>Unorthodox operators</h4></summary>
                    <p>Besides the normal set of binary and arithmetic
                    operators, Oak has a few strange operators.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>assignment operator</strong> <code>:=</code>
                    binds values on the right side to names on the left,
                    potentially by destructuring an object or list. For
                    example:</p>
                    <pre><code>a := 1              // a is 1
[b, c] := [2, 3]    // b is 2, c is 3
d := double(a)      // d is 2</code></pre>
                    <p>The <strong>nonlocal assignment operator</strong>
                    <code>&lt;-</code> binds values on the right side to names
                    on the left, but only when those variables already exist.
                    If the variable doesn't exist in the current scope, the
                    operator ascends up parent scopes until it reaches the
                    global scope to find the last scope where that name was
                    bound.</p>
                    <pre><code>n := 10
m := 20
{
    n &lt;- 30
    m := 40
}
n // 30
m // 20</code></pre>
                    <p>The <strong>push operator</strong> <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
                    pushes values onto the end of a string or a list, mutating
                    it, and returns the changed string or list.</p>
                    <pre><code>str := 'Hello '
str &lt;&lt; 'World!' // 'Hello World!'

list := [1, 2, 3]
list &lt;&lt; 4
list &lt;&lt; 5 &lt;&lt; 6 // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></pre>
                    <p>The <strong>pipe operator</strong> <code>|&gt;</code>
                    takes a value on the left and makes it the first argument
                    to a function call on the right.</p>
                    <pre><code>// print 2n for every prime n in range [0, 10)
range(10) |&gt; filter(prime?) |&gt;
    each(double) |&gt; each(println)

// adding numbers
fn add(a, b) a + b
10 |&gt; add(20) |&gt; add(3) // 33</code></pre>

                    <summary><h4>Importing libraries</h4></summary>
                    <p>Oak code is organized into "modules". A module is a
                    single source file, described by its name or relative path.
                    To use functions and variables defined in one file from
                    another file, use the <code>import()</code> function.</p>
                    <pre><code>std := import('std')
std.println('Hello!')</code></pre>
                    <p><code>import('./path/to/module')</code> returns an
                    object whose keys are the names of all variables defined at
                    the module's top-level scope, and whose values are the
                    values of those variables. If you're familiar with
                    JavaScript's <code>require()</code> module system,
                    <code>import()</code> works very similarly, except that
                    there is no explicit <code>module.exports</code>
                    variable.</p>
                    <p>Standard libraries like <code>std</code>,
                    <code>str</code>, and <a href="/lib/">others</a> can be
                    referenced by their name directly in <code>import</code>.
                    Other modules imported from your file system must be
                    referenced by a relative path, beginning with
                    <code>./</code>, as in
                    <code>utils&nbsp;:=&nbsp;import('./utils')</code>.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><h4>Callbacks and the <code>with</code> expression</h4></summary>
                    <p>Because callback-based asynchronous concurrency is
                    common in Oak, there's special syntax sugar, the
                    <code>with</code> expression, to help. The
                    <code>with</code> syntax lets you place the last argument
                    to a function (usually a callback function) after the
                    function call itself, like this.</p>
                    <pre><code>with readFile('./path') fn(file) {
    println(file)
}

// desugars to
readFile('./path', fn(file) {
    println(file)
})</code></pre>
                    <p>This syntax makes common callback-based patterns easier
                    to read. For example, to read a file:</p>
                    <pre><code>std := import('std')
fs := import('fs')

with fs.readFile('./file.txt') fn(file) if file {
    ? -&gt; std.println('Could not read file!')
    _ -&gt; print(file)
}</code></pre>

                <summary><h3>Consistent style with <code>oak&nbsp;fmt</code></h3></summary>
                <p>Inspired by <a href="https://dotink.co/posts/inkfmt/">inkfmt</a>, as well
                as the many code formatters before it like clang-format, gofmt,
                and prettier, Oak has a canonical code formatter called
                <code>oak fmt</code>. It ships with the Oak CLI, and you can
                invoke it on any file using <code>oak fmt <file></code>.</p>
                <p>By default, <code>oak fmt</code> will take Oak source files,
                format them, and print the result. But most of the time, what
                you want is <code>oak fmt &lt;files&gt; --fix</code>, which
                will modify the files in-place with the correct formatting.
                Another helpful flag, <code>--changes</code>, will run
                <code>git diff</code> to only format Oak source files that have
                uncommitted changes.</p>
                <p>For more information on <code>oak fmt</code>, see
                <code>oak help fmt</code>.</p>

                <summary><h3>Bundling and compiling with <code>oak&nbsp;build</code></h3></summary>
                <p>While the Oak interpreter can run programs and modules
                directly from source code on the file system, Oak also offers a
                build tool, <code>oak build</code>, which can <em>bundle</em>
                an Oak program distributed across many files into a single
                "bundle" source file.  <code>oak build</code> can also
                cross-compile Oak bundles into JavaScript bundles, to run in
                the browser or in JavaScript environments like Node.js and
                Deno. This allows Oak programs to be deployed and distributed
                as single-file programs, both on the server and in the
                browser.</p>
                <p>To build a new bundle, we can simply pass an "entrypoint" to
                the program.</p>
                <pre><code data-lang="sh">oak build --entry src/main.oak --output dist/bundle.oak</code></pre>
                <p>Compiling to JavaScript works similarly, but with the
                <code>--web</code> flag, which turns on JavaScript
                cross-compilation.</p>
                <pre><code data-lang="sh">oak build --entry src/app.js.oak --output dist/bundle.js --web</code></pre>
                <p>The bundler and compiler are built on top of my past work
                with the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/september">September</a>
                toolchain for Ink, but slightly re-architected to support
                bundling and multiple compilation targets. In the future, the
                goal of <code>oak build</code> is to become an optimizing
                compiler and potentially help yield an <code>oak compile</code>
                command that could package the interpreter and an Oak bundle
                into a single executable binary.</p>
